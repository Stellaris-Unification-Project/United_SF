This mod is an effort to combine sci-fi related races in one place. The plan is to create, combine, improve and revive portraits from all available science fiction mods specifically the ones that are no longer updated by their creators. It is an independent mod with focus mainly on portraits. Now there are 220+ races (120+ animated) and increasing. This mod as most other mods is not compatible with achievements.

[h1] Content [/h1]
Current, but not final Sci-Fi sections and animated portraits are listed below: 
•	Babylon 5 – 1 animated (narn); 
•	Mass Effect – about half animated (from EDI, prothean to geth, kett)
•	Star Wars – about half animated (mirialan, zabrak, twi’lek, togruta, sith, chiss, sullustan, jawa, rodian, neimodians, duros)
•	Star Trek – all races animated;
•	Miscellaneous races – na'vi from Avatar, xenomorph, terminator, 2 Star Gate races and 3 PlanetSide factions animated, protoss;
•	Special Stellaris races – all (contingency, unbidden, robots, swarm) races animated;
•	Halo – Cortana, UNCS, prehuman, covenant races;
•	Doctor Who – all races static;
•	Warhammer 40k – all races static;
•	XCOM – all races static.
•	Fantasy - all races animated.

There are also included name lists and planets/systems, but other modifications (prescr. empires, race traits, overhauls, predefinitions) are NOT included as my idea is to make it as universal as possible. If you need additional traits, you can get them from this [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850721710] awesome mod [/url] inspired by various sci-fi themes.

[h1] Random spawning and type of races [/h1]
Random spawning is set to No, so You can decide what races are included in your game. See links to patches:
•	[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=858366182] Activates randomisation for all races[/url]; 
•	[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=876893105] Activates randomisation ONLY for animated races (static ones are hidden) [/url].

Current mod adds races in sections by default considered as for organic races by game, but if you want to play a custom race from this pack as robotic empire (for example, borg, geth and etc.,) subscribe following patch mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&id=1142647596] United Sci-Fi races: Robots.[/url]

Please see also what content of other mods were used for this mod in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/814332008/1842367319511271273] specific discussion thread[/url]. You may also suggest races from outdated mods or new race you have been looking for. No promises, but I consider each suggestion and appreciate your feedback. If You like it, please rate it :).

Naturally I cannot cover all Sci-Fi races/factions, but I will do as much possible from my side to create, animate and improve current mod content that we all could enjoy this awesome game mixed with other sci-fi themes.
